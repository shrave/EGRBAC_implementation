# EGRBAC_implementation
My pythonic implementation of the paper on [EGBRAC](https://profsandhu.com/confrnc/misconf/safwa-iri20.pdf) for Smart home IoTs.

System designed in the [paper](https://profsandhu.com/confrnc/misconf/safwa-iri20.pdf) by Safwa Ameer et al.

A handler that takes list of privileges, users, roles, environments as input. 
A flask server at _server.py_ is made. At this server, any user can send a request to know their current privileges/actions.
